The study focuses on the performance of the United States, China, and France. Additionally, the investigation delves into the gold medal Olympic swim times, particularly in the highly competitive 100m races. The dataset we analyzed was obtained from Kaggle.com, comprising 10 columns and 4359 observations, detailing Olympic swimming events, including distance, stroke, gender, team, athlete names, results, and medals. We created a subset of this data to focus on the years 1912 to 2020. Our hypotheses explore the changes in distribution of Olympic swim medals among the United States, China, and France as well as in improvement in race times, specifically the 100m events. The United States consistently dominated medal earning. China and France demonstrated smaller but consistent performances over specific periods. Additionally, we examined gold medal finish times in 100m races revealing a significant improvement over the time period. This analysis provides insights into the evolution of Olympic swimming, covering medal distributions and trends in finish times. The observed gender-specific nuance in performance trends prompts a reevaluation of training methodologies, technological influences, and societal factors shaping the landscape of competitive swimming. Further multidisciplinary research is recommended to deepen our understanding of these trends and their underlying causes.</h5>

Additionally, technological innovations, including advancements in swimsuit design and pool technologies, may have disproportionately benefited women swimmers. Increased international competitiveness, alongside augmented support and investment in women’s sports programs, likely contribute to fostering an environment conducive to accelerated performance improvements. This hypothesis posits that the observed trends are not merely random variations but indicative of systematic changes in the factors influencing swimming performance.</h5>

Nations that realized early on how important it was to invest in infrastructure and training programs, such as the United States, laid the groundwork for long-term success. Countries with a strong sporting legacy may also benefit from an ingrained culture that nutures athletic talent. A country’s talent pipeline and overall competitiveness in the Olympic swimming arena are influenced by the prior creation of youth development programs, coaching efforts, and competitive swimming leagues. Past choices and expenditures made on sports infrastructure, such as building first-rate swimming pools and training centers, have a lasting impact. The current state of swimming ability in each nation is influenced by past choices made about the importance of different sports, how resources are distributed, and how regulations are formulated.</h5>
